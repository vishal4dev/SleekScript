#configuring initial setup

->To create a new project using Vite (a build tool for modern web development), you can use the following command:  "npm create vite@latest" lets me choose between different frontend templates->react,vue,vanilla

->moved to project folder and installed dependecies : npm i

->installed tailwind css 
->removed unwanted files, removed *app.css

!!!Stuck 1 -> snippets for react would not work , wasted 5-10 mins to no solution. just 5 secs forward the tutor solved the problem
         sol - ES7 extension
               auto rename tag(already present)
               tailwind css intellisence

->Added the initial config to github
-------------------------------------------------------------

->created pages and routes for the project 
       installed react-router-dom
       created routes for all pages    

->created header componets using - flowbite react(wrote a hell lot of styling contexts) 
                                   and react-icons            


-------------------------------------------------------------
//create and run the server

->need to create the backend inside the root directory- why? bcuz when we deploy the app that server is going to read file in the root directory and understand our code

->in the root directory "npm init -y" creates a package.json
->create a folder in the root dir (call it api) and create a file index.js
->to create a simple express server we can use ""const require = require('express')"" but if you want to do the import express from 'express; type then you need to change the type in package.json file to type:module

->added scripts for dev(dev) and user(start) mode
  dev: "nodemon index.js" in the package.json file

to run : npm run dev   
---------------------------------------------------------------
//connect to the database

->use mongodb , made a clustor and connected it to the project 
->databse pass = hotblogs
->to hide the pass from the string of the databse generated we created environment varible
which takes a key and replaces it with a value like the string here, else we'll be uploadiing the password on github
